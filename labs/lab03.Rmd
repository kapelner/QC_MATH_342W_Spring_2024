## Perceptron

You will code the "perceptron learning algorithm" for arbitrary number of features p. Take a look at the comments above the function. Respect the spec below:

```{r}
#' TO-DO: Provide a name for this function 
#'
#' TO-DO: Explain what this function does in a few sentences
#'
#' @param Xinput      TO-DO: Explain this
#' @param y_binary    TO-DO: Explain this
#' @param MAX_ITER    TO-DO: Explain this
#' @param w           TO-DO: Explain this
#'
#' @return            The computed final parameter (weight) as a vector of length p + 1
perceptron_learning_algorithm = function(Xinput, y_binary, MAX_ITER = 1000, w = NULL){
  #TO-DO
}
```

To understand what the algorithm is doing - linear "discrimination" between two response categories, we can draw a picture. First let's make up some very simple training data D.

```{r}
Xy_simple = data.frame(
 response = factor(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)), #nominal
 first_feature = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4),    #continuous
 second_feature = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3)    #continuous
)
```

We haven't spoken about visualization yet, but it is important we do some of it now. Thus, I will write this code for you and you will just run it. First we load the visualization library we're going to use:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
```

We are going to just get some plots and not talk about the code to generate them as we will have a whole unit on visualization using `ggplot2` in the future.

Let's first plot y by the two features so the coordinate plane will be the two features and we use different colors to represent the third dimension, y.

```{r}
simple_viz_obj = ggplot(Xy_simple, aes(x = first_feature, y = second_feature, color = response)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5)
simple_viz_obj
```

TO-DO: Explain this picture.

Now, let us run the algorithm and see what happens:

```{r}
w_vec_simple_per = perceptron_learning_algorithm(
  cbind(Xy_simple$first_feature, Xy_simple$second_feature),
  as.numeric(Xy_simple$response == 1))
w_vec_simple_per
```

Explain this output. What do the numbers mean? What is the intercept of this line and the slope? You will have to do some algebra.

TO-DO


```{r}
simple_perceptron_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = -w_vec_simple_per[1] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    slope = -w_vec_simple_per[2] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    color = "orange")
simple_viz_obj + simple_perceptron_line
```

Explain this picture. Why is this line of separation not "satisfying" to you?

TO-DO 

For extra credit, program the maximum-margin hyperplane perceptron that provides the best linear discrimination model for linearly separable data. Make sure you provide ROxygen documentation for this function.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```




## Support Vector Machine vs. Perceptron

We recreate the data from the previous lab and visualize it:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
Xy_simple = data.frame(
 response = factor(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)), #nominal
 first_feature = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4),    #continuous
 second_feature = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3)    #continuous
)
simple_viz_obj = ggplot(Xy_simple, aes(x = first_feature, y = second_feature, color = response)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5)
simple_viz_obj
```

Use the `e1071` package to fit an SVM model to the simple data. Use a formula to create the model, pass in the data frame, set kernel to be `linear` for the linear SVM and don't scale the covariates. Call the model object `svm_model`. Otherwise the remaining code won't work.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(e1071)
svm_model = svm(
  formula = #TO-DO, 
  data = #TO-DO, 
  kernel = "linear", 
  scale = FALSE
)
```

and then use the following code to visualize the line in purple:

```{r}
w_vec_simple_svm = c(
  svm_model$rho, #the b term
  -t(svm_model$coefs) %*% cbind(Xy_simple$first_feature, Xy_simple$second_feature)[svm_model$index, ] # the other terms
)
simple_svm_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = -w_vec_simple_svm[1] / w_vec_simple_svm[3], 
    slope = -w_vec_simple_svm[2] / w_vec_simple_svm[3], 
    color = "purple")

simple_viz_obj + simple_svm_line
```

Source the `perceptron_learning_algorithm` function from lab 2. Then run the following to fit the perceptron and plot its line in orange with the SVM's line:

```{r}
w_vec_simple_per = perceptron_learning_algorithm(
  cbind(Xy_simple$first_feature, Xy_simple$second_feature),
  as.numeric(Xy_simple$response == 1)
)
simple_perceptron_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = -w_vec_simple_per[1] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    slope = -w_vec_simple_per[2] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    color = "orange")

simple_viz_obj + simple_perceptron_line + simple_svm_line
```

Is this SVM line a better fit than the perceptron?

TO-DO

Now write pseuocode for your own implementation of the linear support vector machine algorithm using the Vapnik objective function we discussed.

Note there are differences between this spec and the perceptron learning algorithm spec in question #1. You should figure out a way to respect the `MAX_ITER` argument value. 


```{r}
#' Support Vector Machine 
#
#' This function implements the hinge-loss + maximum margin linear support vector machine algorithm of Vladimir Vapnik (1963).
#'
#' @param Xinput      The training data features as an n x p matrix.
#' @param y_binary    The training data responses as a vector of length n consisting of only 0's and 1's.
#' @param MAX_ITER    The maximum number of iterations the algorithm performs. Defaults to 5000.
#' @param lambda      A scalar hyperparameter trading off margin of the hyperplane versus average hinge loss.
#'                    The default value is 1.
#' @return            The computed final parameter (weight) as a vector of length p + 1
linear_svm_learning_algorithm = function(Xinput, y_binary, MAX_ITER = 5000, lambda = 0.1){
  #TO-DO: write pseudo code in comments
}
```


If you are enrolled in 342W the following is extra credit but if you're enrolled in a masters section, the following is required. Write the actual code. You may want to take a look at the `optimx` package. You can feel free to define another function (a "private" function) in this chunk if you wish. R has a way to create public and private functions, but I believe you need to create a package to do that (beyond the scope of this course).

```{r}
#' This function implements the hinge-loss + maximum margin linear support vector machine algorithm of Vladimir Vapnik (1963).
#'
#' @param Xinput      The training data features as an n x p matrix.
#' @param y_binary    The training data responses as a vector of length n consisting of only 0's and 1's.
#' @param MAX_ITER    The maximum number of iterations the algorithm performs. Defaults to 5000.
#' @param lambda      A scalar hyperparameter trading off margin of the hyperplane versus average hinge loss.
#'                    The default value is 1.
#' @return            The computed final parameter (weight) as a vector of length p + 1
linear_svm_learning_algorithm = function(Xinput, y_binary, MAX_ITER = 5000, lambda = 0.1){
  #TO-DO
}
```

If you wrote code (the extra credit), run your function using the defaults and plot it in brown vis-a-vis the previous model's line:

```{r}
svm_model_weights = linear_svm_learning_algorithm(X_simple_feature_matrix, y_binary)
my_svm_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = svm_model_weights[1] / svm_model_weights[3],#NOTE: negative sign removed from intercept argument here
    slope = -svm_model_weights[2] / svm_model_weights[3], 
    color = "brown")
simple_viz_obj  + my_svm_line
```

Is this the same as what the `e1071` implementation returned? Why or why not?

TO-DO

## Multinomial Classification using KNN

Write a k = 1 nearest neighbor algorithm using the Euclidean distance function. The following comments are standard "Roxygen" format for documentation. Hopefully, we will get to packages at some point and we will go over this again. It is your job also to fill in this documentation.

```{r}
#' TO-DO: Provide a name for this function 
#'
#' TO-DO: Explain what this function does in a few sentences
#'
#' @param Xinput      TO-DO: explain this argument
#' @param y_binary    TO-DO: explain this argument
#' @param Xtest       TO-DO: explain this argument
#' @return            TO-DO: explain this argument
nn_algorithm_predict = function(Xinput, y_binary, Xtest){
  #TO-DO
}
```

Write a few tests to ensure it actually works:

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

We now add an argument `d` representing any legal distance function to the `nn_algorithm_predict` function. Update the implementation so it performs NN using that distance function. Set the default function to be the Euclidean distance in the original function. Also, alter the documentation in the appropriate places.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

For extra credit (unless you're a masters student), add an argument `k` to the `nn_algorithm_predict` function and update the implementation so it performs KNN. In the case of a tie, choose yhat randomly. Set the default `k` to be the square root of the size of D which is an empirical rule-of-thumb popularized by the "Pattern Classification" book by Duda, Hart and Stork (2007). Also, alter the documentation in the appropriate places.

```{r}
#TO-DO for the 650 students but extra credit for undergrads
```

## Regression via OLS with one feature

Let's quickly recreate the sample data set from practice lecture 7:

```{r}
set.seed(1984)
n = 20
x = runif(n)
beta_0 = 3
beta_1 = -2
```

Compute h^* as `h_star_x`, then draw epsilon from an iid N(0, 0.33^2) distribution as `epsilon`, then compute the vector y.

```{r}
h_star_x = #TO-DO 
epsilon = #TO-DO
y = #TO-DO
```

Graph the data by running the following chunk:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
simple_df = data.frame(x = x, y = y)
simple_viz_obj = ggplot(simple_df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2)
simple_viz_obj
```

Does this make sense given the values of beta_0 and beta_1?

Write a function `my_simple_ols` that takes in a vector `x` and vector `y` and returns a list that contains the `b_0` (intercept), `b_1` (slope), `yhat` (the predictions), `e` (the residuals), `SSE`, `SST`, `MSE`, `RMSE` and `Rsq` (for the R-squared metric). Internally, you can only use the functions `sum` and `length` and other basic arithmetic operations. You should throw errors if the inputs are non-numeric or not the same length. You should also name the class of the return value `my_simple_ols_obj` by using the `class` function as a setter. No need to create ROxygen documentation here.

```{r}
my_simple_ols = function(x, y){
  ols_obj = list()
  #TO-DO
  
  class(ols_obj) = "my_simple_ols_obj"
  ols_obj
}
```

Verify your computations are correct for the vectors `x` and `y` from the first chunk using the `lm` function in R:

```{r}
lm_mod = #TO-DO
my_simple_ols_mod = #TO-DO
#run the tests to ensure the function is up to spec
pacman::p_load(testthat)
expect_equal(my_simple_ols_mod$b_0, as.numeric(coef(lm_mod)[1]), tol = 1e-4)
expect_equal(my_simple_ols_mod$b_1, as.numeric(coef(lm_mod)[2]), tol = 1e-4)
expect_equal(my_simple_ols_mod$RMSE, summary(lm_mod)$sigma, tol = 1e-4)
expect_equal(my_simple_ols_mod$Rsq, summary(lm_mod)$r.squared, tol = 1e-4)
```

Verify that the average of the residuals is 0 using the `expect_equal`. Hint: use the syntax above.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Create the $X$ matrix for this data example. Make sure it has the correct dimension.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Use the `model.matrix` function to compute the matrix `X` and verify it is the same as your manual construction.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Create a prediction method `g` that takes in a vector `x_star` and `my_simple_ols_obj`, an object of type `my_simple_ols_obj` and predicts y values for each entry in `x_star`. 

```{r}
g = function(my_simple_ols_obj, x_star){
  #TO-DO
}
```

Use this function to verify that when predicting for the average x, you get the average y.

```{r}
expect_equal(g(my_simple_ols_obj, mean(x)), mean(y))
```


In class we spoke about error due to ignorance, misspecification error and estimation error. Show that as n grows, estimation error shrinks. Let us define an error metric that is the difference between b_0 and b_1 and beta_0 and beta_1. How about ||b - beta||^2 where the quantities are now the vectors of size two. Show as n increases, this shrinks. 

```{r}
beta_0 = 3
beta_1 = -2
beta = c(beta_0, beta_1)

ns = #TO-DO
errors = array(NA, length(ns))
for (i in 1 : length(ns)) {
  n = ns[i]
  x = runif(n)
  h_star_x = beta_0 + beta_1 * x 
  epsilon = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.33)
  y = h_star_x + epsilon
  
  #TO-DO
  errors[i] = sum((beta - b)^2)
}
errors
```


We are now going to repeat one of the first linear model building exercises in history --- that of Sir Francis Galton in 1886. First load up package `HistData`.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(HistData)
```

In it, there is a dataset called `Galton`. Load it up.

```{r}
data(Galton)
```

You now should have a data frame in your workspace called `Galton`. Summarize this data frame and write a few sentences about what you see. Make sure you report n, p and a bit about what the columns represent and how the data was measured. See the help file `?Galton`.
p is 1 and n is 928 the number of observations  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(skimr)
skim(Galton)
```

TO-DO

Find the average height (include both parents and children in this computation).

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

If you were predicting child height from parent and you were using the null model, what would the RMSE be of this model be?

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Note that in Math 241 you learned that the sample average is an estimate of the "mean", the population expected value of height. We will call the average the "mean" going forward since it is probably correct to the nearest tenth of an inch with this amount of data.

Run a linear model attempting to explain the childrens' height using the parents' height. Use `lm` and use the R formula notation. Compute and report b_0, b_1, RMSE and R^2. 

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Interpret all four quantities: b_0, b_1, RMSE and R^2. Use the correct units of these metrics in your answer.

TO-DO

How good is this model? How well does it predict? Discuss.

TO-DO

It is reasonable to assume that parents and their children have the same height? Explain why this is reasonable using basic biology and common sense.

TO-DO

If they were to have the same height and any differences were just random noise with expectation 0, what would the values of beta_0 and beta_1 be?

TO-DO

Let's plot (a) the data in D as black dots, (b) your least squares line defined by b_0 and b_1 in blue, (c) the theoretical line beta_0 and beta_1 if the parent-child height equality held in red and (d) the mean height in green.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
ggplot(Galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_abline(intercept = b_0, slope = b_1, color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red", size = 1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = avg_height, slope = 0, color = "darkgreen", size = 1) +
  xlim(63.5, 72.5) + 
  ylim(63.5, 72.5) +
  coord_equal(ratio = 1)
```

Fill in the following sentence: 

TO-DO: Children of short parents became ... on average and children of tall parents became ... on average.

Why did Galton call it "Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature" which was later shortened to "regression to the mean"?

TO-DO

Why should this effect be real?

TO-DO

You now have unlocked the mystery. Why is it that when modeling with y continuous, everyone calls it "regression"? Write a better, more descriptive and appropriate name for building predictive models with y continuous.

TO-DO

You can now clear the workspace.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Create a dataset D which we call `Xy` such that the linear model has R^2 about 50\% and RMSE approximately 1.

```{r}
x = #TO-DO
y = #TO-DO
Xy = data.frame(x = x, y = y)
```

Create a dataset D which we call `Xy` such that the linear model has R^2 about 0\% but x, y are clearly associated.

```{r}
x = #TO-DO
y = #TO-DO
Xy = data.frame(x = x, y = y)
```

Extra credit but required for 650 students: create a dataset D and a model that can give you R^2 arbitrarily close to 1 i.e. approximately 1 - epsilon but RMSE arbitrarily high i.e. approximately M.

```{r}
epsilon = 0.01
M = 1000
#TO-DO
```


Write a function `my_ols` that takes in `X`, a matrix with with p columns representing the feature measurements for each of the n units, a vector of n responses `y` and returns a list that contains the `b`, the p+1-sized column vector of OLS coefficients, `yhat` (the vector of n predictions), `e` (the vector of n residuals), `df` for degrees of freedom of the model, `SSE`, `SST`, `MSE`, `RMSE` and `Rsq` (for the R-squared metric). Internally, you cannot use `lm` or any other package; it must be done manually. You should throw errors if the inputs are non-numeric or not the same length. Or if `X` is not otherwise suitable. You should also name the class of the return value `my_ols` by using the `class` function as a setter. No need to create ROxygen documentation here.


```{r}
my_ols = function(X, y){
  #TO-DO
}
```

Verify that the OLS coefficients for the `Type` of cars in the cars dataset gives you the same results as we did in class (i.e. the ybar's within group). 

```{r}
#TO-DO
```


Create a prediction method `g` that takes in a vector `x_star` and the dataset D i.e. `X` and `y` and returns the OLS predictions. Let `X` be a matrix with with p columns representing the feature measurements for each of the n units

```{r}
g = function(x_star, X, y){
  #TO-DO
}
```
